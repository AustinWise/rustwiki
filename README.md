# rust wiki (better name TBD)

The aspiration goal of this project is to create a wiki software with these
properties:

* Comparable in functionality to and compatible with GitHub wikis. This includes:
  * Git is the backing store
  * Markdown is used to format pages
* Easy to run on your local computer.
* Really fast and easy to install.

Non goals include:

* Support for multiple users. This wiki is for your eyes only.

Phrased in another way, the goal of this project is to create something roughly
like [Gollum](https://github.com/gollum/gollum), but does not take half an hour
to `gem install` on a low-powered Chromebook.

## Why Rust, please tell me more about why you love Rust

Rust makes it easy to ship compiled executables that run without much fuss.
As for why not some other language also shares this capability (Go or C#),
I just want to get more experience working with Rust.
